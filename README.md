# interactive-AI-game
## Welcome to this project!

This is a prototype of a game which lets the player control a predator, whose objective is to devour prey agents. The agents learn to avoid the player from experience in real time. 

## Neural network
### LSTM

The agents are controlled by an LSTM, which is fed time series consisting of:
1. distances to the predator,
2. angles in relation to the predator direction.
